## Quick start

https://docs.docker.com/compose/:[Docker Compose] is the easiest way to setup the Kill Bill stack:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.kb.yml -p kb up
```

Use `docker-machine env <name>` or the environment variable `$DOCKER_HOST` to get the IP address of the container.

Then go to `http://<IP_ADDRESS>:9090/` and log-in via `admin/password`.

## Logging and Metrics infrastructure

The `Makefile` generates a Docker Compose file which sets up the Kill Bill stack along with services for logging and recording metrics.

To launch the full stack, run:

....
make
....

Notes:

* the `Makefile` will look for the Docker container IP via `docker-machine ip default`. Adapt to your setup if necessary.
* `docker-compose logs` wonâ€™t work, because all logs are forwarded to http://<IP_ADDRESS>:5601[Elasticsearch]. The easiest way to find logs for a specific container is to search for the container ID in Kibana.
* You need several GB of RAM to run the entire stack in the host: on Mac-OS, open Virtual Box and check the VM has 2GB or more of RAM (you need to poweroff the VM first).

### Logging

The https://www.elastic.co/webinars/introduction-elk-stack:[Elastic Stack] setup (Elasticseach, Logstash, Kibana) is provided in the `docker-compose.elk.yml` file.

It will give you the ability to analyze any data set by using the searching/aggregation capabilities of Elasticseach and the visualization power of Kibana.

Logstash listens on 1514 (Syslog protocol). For debugging purposes, the stdout plugin is enabled:

`docker logs -f elk_logstash_1`

The Kibana UI is available at `http://<IP_ADDRESS>:5601`. Port 9200 for Elasticsearch is open for available to the host for Sense.

### Metrics

The `docker-compose.gi.yml` file sets up Telegraf, InfluxDB, cAdvisor and Grafana.

The Grafana UI is available at `http://<IP_ADDRESS>:3000` (default credentials: `admin:admin`).

When running the full stack, Grafana uses the MariaDB container as the storage backend. To configure it (default database credentials `root:killbill`):

....
CREATE DATABASE grafana;
USE grafana;
CREATE TABLE `session` (
    `key`       CHAR(16) NOT NULL,
    `data`      BLOB,
    `expiry`    INT(11) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (`key`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
....

You also need to add the InfluxDB datasources. Got to http://<IP_ADDRESS>:3000/datasources/new:

* Name: influxdb
* Type: InfluxDB
* Url: http://influxdb:8086
* Database: killbill
* User: killbill
* Password: killbill
